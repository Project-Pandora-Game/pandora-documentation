# Documentation for Project Pandora

This repository currently contains high-level documentation about Project Pandora.
This documentation is aimed at developers, asset creators, and people interested in how things work or why some things are the way they are.

As we are stretched a bit thin and this is just a hobby project, documentation present here might be slightly outdated (the very outdated bits are in the `outdated` folder only) or incomplete. We apologize about this.

If you have any questions please feel free to contact us on our Discord server.
It is especially advisable to align with us before you make a (larger) contribution in the form of code or assets.
