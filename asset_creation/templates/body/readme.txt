These are the body templates for drawing anything that covers breasts or is affected by breast size.
These images represent a specific breast slider state, namely:

['flat', -180]
['small', -150]
['medium', - 70]
['large', 0]
['huge', 100]
['extreme', 180]

Depending on the quality needs and the details in the shadows/shading and/or item details around the breast more item images for these 6 body templates are needed to be able to draw all intermediate states on the breast slider.

For simple items with not many details, two images may be sufficient. Typically, four are recommended. All six are needed only in rare cases.

Simple items need images for:
flat & large

Typical items need images for:
flat, small, large & extreme

Complex/detailed items need images for:
flat, small, large, huge, extreme

Very complex/detailed items need images for:
flat, small, medium, large, huge, extreme
